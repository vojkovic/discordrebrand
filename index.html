        <p class='pblack'>
            At Discord, our main motive has always been to bring people together.
            However, over the years, we've realised that video calls and group 
            chats just aren't the way to do it. We've seen case after case of 
            youth with heightened mental health issues due to our services. 
            We can no longer deny that social media is harming our youth. The 
            Discord of the future will cease this harming of our children
            and we can finally complete our goal of bringing people together.

            Discord is proud to release our latests products, a wide suite of
            cords. Yes, that's right. We're putting the cord back into Discord.
            No matter if you are a home consumer or professional, we'll be sure
            to make high quality cords you'll love. The sale of premimum quality
            cords commenses today. We are currently manufacturing VGA, DVI, fibre
            optic ethernet, USB, 5mm Audio, PS/2 and our flagship HDMI cables.
            This HDMI cable will revolutionise the industry. With our patented
            conductor material, a new range of video resolutions and refresh rates
            have been unlocked. Out of the box, this cord has the capacity to run an
            8K display at 160Hz or 4K at 360Hz. Furthermore, this will be the first
            cord to support 16K resolution. Dynamic HDR formats are supported 
            ensuring your display is true to life.

            As mentioned before, we want to stop harming youth who are using our 
            platform. With the conclusion of the 2021 Glasgow climate summit, we've 
            reevaluated our commitment to the climate. We've doubled down on our 
            sustainability by shutting down our costly fossil fuel powered server 
            infrastructure. Furthermore, all cords produced by Discord will be 100% 
            recycled and will be fair trade certified. The rare metals inside cables 
            are often obtained from exploiting developing nations and children. We 
            commit to working closely with our material suppliers, ensuring this
            event will not take place at Discord. Our last goal is to product high
            quality cables that are loved by a range of people.
